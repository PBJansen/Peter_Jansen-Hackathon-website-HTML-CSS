            <p>
                SpaceX Mars program is a development program initiated by Elon Musk and SpaceX in order to facilitate
                the eventual colonization of Mars. The program includes fully reusable launch vehicles, human-rated
                spacecraft, on-orbit propellant tankers, rapid-turnaround launch/landing mounts, and local production of
                rocket fuel on Mars via in situ resource utilization (ISRU). SpaceX's aspirational goal has been to land
                the first humans on Mars by 2024, but in October 2020 Elon Musk named 2024 as goal for an uncrewed
                mission. At the Axel Springer Award 2020 Elon Musk said that he is highly confident that the first
                crewed flights to Mars will happen in 2026.

            <h3>The SpaceX Starship</h3>

            <p>
                As of 2020, the SpaceX Starship is planned to be a long-duration cargo- and passenger-carrying
                spacecraft launched as the second stage of a reusable launch vehicle. While it will be tested on
                its own initially, it will be used on orbital launches with an additional booster stage, the Super
                Heavy, where Starship will serve as the second stage on a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle. The
                combination of spacecraft and booster is called Starship as well.

            <h4>Overview and major elements</h4>

            <p>
                <li>a new fully reusable super heavy-lift launch vehicle that consists of a reusable booster stage and a
                    reusable integrated second-stage-with-spacecraft that comes in at least two versions: a large,
                    long-duration, beyond-Earth-orbit spacecraft capable of carrying passengers, bulk cargo, or
                    propellant cargo, to other Solar System destinations. The combination of a second-stage of a
                    launch vehicle with a long-duration spacecraft is unusual for any space mission architecture, and
                    has not been seen in previous spaceflight technology.</li>
                <li>refilling of propellants in orbit, specifically to enable the long-journey spacecraft to expend
                    almost all of its propellant load during the launch to low Earth orbit while it serves as the second
                    stage of the launch vehicle, and then—after refilling on orbit—provide the significant amount of
                    energy necessary to put the spacecraft onto an interplanetary trajectory.</li>
                <li>propellant production on the surface of Mars: to enable the return trip back to Earth and support
                    reuse of the spacecraft, enabling significantly lower cost to transport cargo and passengers to
                    distant destinations. Once again, the large propellant tanks in the integrated space vehicle are
                    filled remotely.</li>
                <li>selection of the right propellant: Methane (CH4)/oxygen (O2)—also known as "deep cryo
                    methalox" :16:25—was selected as it was considered better than other common space vehicle
                    propellants like Kerolox or Hydrolox principally due to ease of production on Mars and the lower
                    cost of the propellants on Earth when evaluated from an overall system optimization perspective.
                    Methalox was considered equivalent to one of the other primary options in terms of vehicle
                    reusability, on-orbit propellant transfer, and appropriateness for super-heavy vehicles.</li>
