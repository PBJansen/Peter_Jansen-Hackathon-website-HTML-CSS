            <h2>What do we do on Mars?</h2>

            <p>
                one of our best bets is to land on the Korolev crater wich is 81km wide and filled with water ice. On
                the surface its not possible to form water, because the atmosphere isnt thick enough. however pockets of
                water locked up in ice can be found at the bottom of craters where it is cold enough. On Mars there is
                also the possibility of settling near underground water deposits, found in permafrost under the crust.
                Studies based on data from Mars orbiters have revealed and mapped out locations for water under the
                ground all across the planet. Another option would be to look for lava tubes, A lava tube is basically a
                long cave that formed when magma flowed trough it.

                Once the location has been chosen, forerunner missions will have to take place, laying the foundations
                autonomously for what the colonists will need. Using 3D printing techniques through autonomous robots.
                Basically this concept required excavating material from the surface, which would then be processed and
                mixed with water ice into something similar to concrete. This structure is than 3D printed layer by
                layer by autonomous robots. These structures are needed because Mars does not have a magnetic field like
                Earth, so radiation is a big problem. Energy would be produced by solar panels.

            <h3>MOXIE</h3>

            </p>
            The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment is better known as MOXIE. NASA is preparing for
            human exploration of Mars, and MOXIE will demonstrate a way that future explorers might produce oxygen from
            the Martian atmosphere for propellant and for breathing. MOXIE Makes Oxygen on Mars, Carbon dioxide makes up
            ~96% of the gas in Mars' atmosphere. Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared to 21% in Earth's atmosphere. MOXIE
            makes oxygen like a tree does. It inhales carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen. If we could scale-up the MOXIE
            maybe we could eventually create a oxygen rich enviroment on Mars with a atmosphere to protect against
            radiation.
