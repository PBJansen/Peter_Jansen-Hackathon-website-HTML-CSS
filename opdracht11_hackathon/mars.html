            <p>
                At an average distance of 140 million miles, Mars is one of Earth's closest habitable neighbors. Mars is
                about half again as far from the Sun as Earth is, so it still has decent sunlight. It is a little cold,
                but we can warm it up. Its atmosphere is primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other
                trace elements, which means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere. Gravity
                on Mars is about 38% of that of Earth, so you would be able to lift heavy things and bound around.
                Furthermore, the day is remarkably close to that of Earth.

                Reasons for colonizing Mars include pure curiosity,
                the potential for humans to provide more in-depth observational research than unmanned rovers,
                economic interest in its resources, and the possibility that the settlement of other planets could
                decrease the likelihood of human extinction.

                I will discuss two different scenarios i find interesting to explain why its important to terraform Mars
                and become a multiplanetary species.

            <h3>Earth is a target in a cosmic shooting gallery</h3>

            <p>
                The terrestrial impact rate appears to be substantially higher than current near-earth-object population
                models imply, consistent with a significant unseen cometary contribution to the terrestrial impact
                hazard. As a result of a growing number of asteroid and comet discoveries in recent years by dedicated
                'Spaceguard' survey programmes aimed at finding near-earth objects (NEOs) on potentially Earth-colliding
                trajectoties, and as result too of improved dynamical modelling of the NEO population, the impact rate
                by NEOs of various sizes is thought to be faily well constrained. The problem can be approached in at
                least three ways. One is simply to model the whole population of potential impactors, based on objects
                discovered during large scale surveys. A second is to consider the cratered surfaces of the Earth and
                Moon, and estimate the flux of different-sized projectiles by counting craters. A third is to focus
                attention on the objects that happebn to pass very close to Earth. Although there are relatively few
                sutch objects, this method has the advantage of constraining the flux of relatively smal and/or faint
                objects.Moreover, objects that actually collide with Earth, or pass (predicted to pass) very close,
                represent observational 'ground truth' so far as impact statistics are concerned.

            <h3>The Fermi paradox (It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself) </h3>

            <p>
                The Fermi paradox, named after Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, is the apparent contradiction
                between the lack of evidence for extraterrestrial civilizations and various high estimates for their
                probability. One hypothesis is "It is the nature of intelligent life to destroy itself".
                This is the argument that technological civilizations may usually or invariably destroy themselves
                before or shortly after developing radio or spaceflight technology. The astrophysicist Sebastian von
                Hoerner stated that the progress of science and technology on Earth was driven by two factors—the
                struggle for domination and the desire for an easy life. The former potentially leads to complete
                destruction, while the latter may lead to biological or mental degeneration. What it boils down to
                is, we are primitive apes handling atom bombs, technology advanced faster than human beings can handle.
